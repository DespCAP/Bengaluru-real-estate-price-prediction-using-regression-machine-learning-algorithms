Various Regression ML algorithms are used to predict the housing price in Bengaluru.

The application of regression machine learning models to analyze Bengaluru's house price data yielded valuable insights into the city's real estate market. The findings emphasized the significance of various factors, such as location, property size, amenities, historical trends, and regulatory changes, in influencing house prices. These models can serve as a valuable tool for potential home buyers, real estate developers, and investors in making informed decisions and understanding market trends. For potential homebuyers, the analysis highlighted the importance of considering location and nearby amenities when evaluating properties. Properties with easy access to business centers, educational institutions, and recreational facilities are likely to retain their value and offer better appreciation over time.
Analyzing past data can aid in identifying investment opportunities, mitigating risks, and maximizing returns in a competitive market like Bengaluru. However, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations of the study. The accuracy of the predictive models relies heavily on the quality and comprehensiveness of the dataset. Additionally, external factors like economic conditions, geopolitical events, and technological advancements can also influence the real estate market and must be considered in conjunction with the model's predictions. In conclusion, this project's exploration of Bengaluru's house price data using regression machine learning models provides valuable insights into the factors shaping the city's real estate market. The knowledge gained can empower stakeholders to make well-informed decisions, navigate the complex market landscape, and ultimately contribute to a thriving and sustainable real estate sector in Bengaluru.
